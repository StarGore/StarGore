## <a href="https://lapisbot.xyz/" URL> NoloS </a>
I'm Nolos and I'm a guy that is programming public Discord Bots in JavaScript. I also have a considerable amount of experience in coding and designing websites through HTML/CSS and had many bits of peeks in MATLAB.
My latest project my friends and I are working on is <a href="https://top.gg/servers/967412084746883072" URL> Lapis Bot</a>.
